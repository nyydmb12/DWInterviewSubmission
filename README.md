# DWInterviewSubmission
This is my submission for Referral Rock. The system assumes there is 1 program, and it displays all members associated with that program. Upon selecting a member, a new tab opens containing a table with all the referrals for that member. A referral can be selected for editing, deleted, or a new referral can be created.

### Assumpitons
*Cross site request forgery is not a concern. Without implementing a login, implementing anti forgery tokens didnâ€™t make sense
*What should be on the screen is based loosely on Referral Rock's user interface

### Setup
Setup should be seamless as requested, the project is using .NET 5 and React, so as long as your Visual Studio is up to date it should run itself
